		<h3><a href="">Major release and site redesign!</a><d>28 Dec 2013</d></h3>
		<hr>
		<p>We redesigned our website. We hope you like the new style.</p>
		<p>We also released a bunch of new tools. There are over 600 tools in the repo
			now. The full list of tools is <a href="tools.html">here</a>.</p>
		<br/><br/>
		<h3><a href="">Updates to Pacman.conf!</a><d>20 Dec 2013</d></h3>
		<hr>
		<p>We changed the directory structure of the repository. Please modify your
			pacman.conf files like so:
			<br /><br />
			<b>[blackarch] <br/>
				Server = http://blackarch.org/blackarch/$repo/os/$arch</b>
			<br /><br />
			The repository directory structure now resembles that of the official Arch
			repositories. The new structure will make it easier for mirrors to sync with
			our repository.</p>
		<br/><br/>
		<h3><a href="">We did it!</a><d>24 Nov 2013</d></h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Thanks to everyone's interest in this project we finally pissed off our ISP!
			It makes us happy to know that so many people appreciate our hard work and are
			using BlackArch Linux. We have managed to push a record 1.2TB a month of traffic
			and downloads. The shiny new server is up and alive, thank you for being patient
			with us. We are currently replicating mirrors across the USA to help with any
			potential future disruptions. For the latest updates please come back and visit
			us or follow us on twitter. Thanks everyone!</p>

		<h3><a href="">Extended downtime</a><d>25 Aug 2013</d></h3>
		<hr>
		<p>We're continuing work to upgrade our infrastructure, as a part of this
			improvement our domain service provider experienced some issues which resulted
			in slow proprogation of our DNS records across the globe. This was the root
			cause of our extended downtime. This issue has now been corrected, we apologize
			for the inconvenience.</p>

		<h3><a href="">Speak candidly</a><d>24 Aug 2013</d></h3>
		<hr>
		<p> We have recently relocated all tools in the repository to comply with
			<a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">FHS</a>. We would like to hear from
			anyone that was familiar with the <code>/pentest</code> path structure and how
			they feel about the current format. Did anyone depend on <code>/pentest</code>
			to remember what tools you have in your arsenal? Do you prefer having all tools
			available to you in your <code>$PATH</code>? Please feel free to comment below
			and speak your mind!</p>
